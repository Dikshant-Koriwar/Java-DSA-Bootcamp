# My Coding Journey

Welcome to my coding journey! This repository is a record of my progress as I learn the fundamentals of programming and build small projects. I'm excited to share my experiences, challenges, and victories as I embark on this path.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Dikshant, an aspiring developer passionate about technology and problem-solving. I'm new to coding, and I'm here to learn, experiment, and document my journey from the basics to more advanced topics.

## Goals

- **Learn Programming Fundamentals:** Understand variables, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.
- **Build Projects:** Start with simple projects like "Hello World" programs and gradually work on more complex applications.
- **Master Data Structures & Algorithms:** Develop a solid foundation in essential data structures and algorithms.
- **Collaborate & Contribute:** Engage with the coding community, seek feedback, and contribute to open-source projects.

## Learning Path

- **Programming Languages:**  
  Starting with languages like Python and JavaScript. As I progress, I'll explore Java, C++, or others that fit my learning goals.
  
- **Concepts to Explore:**  
  - Basics (syntax, loops, conditionals)
  - Data Structures (arrays, lists, stacks, queues)
  - Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion)
  - Version Control with Git and GitHub

- **Resources:**  
  - [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
  - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
  - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  - [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/)

## Projects

Here are a few projects that I'll be working on:

- **Hello World:**  
  My very first project to get familiar with the basics of a programming language.

- **Simple Calculator:**  
  A project to practice using functions and handling user input.

- **To-Do List Application:**  
  A small application to manage tasks and learn about user interface design and data handling.

*More projects will be added as I learn and grow in my coding skills.*

## How to Use This Repository

- **Explore the Code:**  
  Each project is organized in its own folder with code, documentation, and notes on what I've learned.
